You are a text forensic expert. You are analyzing a "flattened" text blob of a poem where all newlines were deleted. You do not know this poem, so you must reconstruct it using only forensic clues.

<task>
Reconstruct the poem's likely formatting based **strictly** on the text clues in the blob.
</task>

<guidelines>
1. **Capitalization:** In traditional poetry, a capital letter following punctuation usually signals a new line.
2. **Rhyme & Rhythm:** Read the text aloud (internally) to find the meter. Break lines where the rhythm naturally pauses or rhymes occur.
3. **Artifact Repair:** The flattening process deleted spaces between lines.
   - Look for fused words like "courageyou" -> split into "courage you".
   - Look for "sunrisetoward" -> split into "sunrise toward".
4. **Stanzas:** If the narrative shifts significantly, insert a double newline `\n\n`.
</guidelines>
